Hi All,

I write to inform you that we had issues deploying M2 ZA version 1.2.3 because of the large media shared files. It will not be good to just make a deployment that will caused a long downtime before it is fixed. 

The issue was also noted to affect the deployment of M2 MA version 1.0.2. Hence, we are cancelling all the deployment scheduled for today, 14th Feb., 2018. 

This cancellation will allow us to fix the issue, perform another round of sanity check before deployment will be done.

I will communicate you when next these deployments will take place. 

Regards,
